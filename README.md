<h1>📊  Manufacturing Defects & Downtime Analysis Dashboard</h1> 

### [📽️ Project Walkthrough (Optional YouTube Link)](https://your-youtube-link.com)  

<h2>📌 Project Description</h2>  
This Power BI project provides an interactive dashboard that provides in-depth analysis of manufacturing defects, downtime hours, and associated costs. It helps stakeholders track performance trends, identify worst-performing vendors and plants, and optimize production efficiency. The dashboard visualizes key KPIs, trends, and insights using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX.

<h2>📈 Key Metrics & Insights</h2>  
<br>✅ The sharp increase in defects and downtime costs suggests production inefficiencies or supply chain issues that need further investigation.</b>   
<br>✅ Focus on root cause analysis for these months—potentially related to raw materials, workforce availability, or equipment failures.</b>          
<br>✅ Top Vendors with High Downtime may require contract renegotiation or quality audits to mitigate losses.</b>                                     
<br>✅ Mechanical failures contribute the most to defect-related downtime, suggesting a need for preventative maintenance strategies.</b>   
<br>✅ Reducing rejected rates could directly improve revenue by improving quality control processes.</b>   
<br>✅ Worst performing plants require immediate efficiency improvements—either through process automation or staff training.</b>    
<br>✅ Defect quantities peaked in April & October which potentially related to raw materials, workforce availability, or equipment failures.</b>
